                <h2 className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8 mt-16">Introduction: A 2025 Perspective</h2>

                <p className="text-xl sm:text-2xl text-gray-800 leading-[1.8] mb-10">
                  In 2010, I published a small book about hydrogen: a curated collection of news, pilot projects,
                  and institutional declarations capturing the excitement around hydrogen as a promising clean energy
                  vector. I remember the enthusiasm at trade shows, the regional pilot programs in Bolzano, Monza,
                  and Sicily, and the widespread narrative: hydrogen as the cornerstone of a sustainable energy future.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-[1.9] mb-8">
                  Time passed. That promise partly evolved into delay, disappointment, and re-evaluation — but also into innovation.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-[1.9] mb-8">
                  Today, in 2025, the energy landscape has changed radically. Hydrogen is still part of the conversation,
                  but it's no longer the whole picture. Other technologies have matured and converged. Over the past
                  fifteen years, my work expanded across smart grids, decentralized generation, batteries, energy
                  efficiency, and advanced control systems — while I continued to follow hydrogen not as a believer,
                  but as a critical observer.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-[1.9] mb-8">
                  This is not a celebration of hydrogen, nor a critique. It's a technical reflection and a perspective
                  exercise: what we got right, what we misunderstood, and where we might still be surprised. Yes, it
                  talks about hydrogen — but more importantly, it talks about systems, complexity, and decisions.

                <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-[1.9] mb-8">
                  2009 felt like the dawn of a new hydrogen era. Conferences, prototypes, and public demonstrations
                  carried an almost evangelical optimism: the hydrogen future was finally arriving.

                <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-[1.9] mb-8">
                  That year, major automakers openly aligned around a target: 2015 as the moment fuel cell electric
                  vehicles (FCEVs) would reach the market — assuming hydrogen fueling infrastructure could be built.
                  Toyota's U.S. advanced-technology leadership publicly argued there was a "clear path" to fuel cell
                  commercialization by 2015, casting doubt on the long-term role of plug-in battery cars.

                <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-[1.9] mb-8">By late 2009, hydrogen mobility wasn't theoretical:</p>

                <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-[1.9] mb-8">
                  <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">GM's Project Driveway</strong> had placed 119 fuel-cell Chevy Equinox SUVs with ordinary drivers, surpassing
                  one million miles by September 2009.

                  <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Honda</strong> was leasing FCX Clarity in California and Japan (at very high cost per unit).

                <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-[1.9] mb-8">
                  In <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Vancouver</strong>, 20 hydrogen buses were delivered for the 2010 Winter Olympics — the largest hydrogen
                  bus fleet in the world at that time.

                  In <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Germany</strong>, the Clean Energy Partnership tested fuel-cell cars in Berlin and Hamburg while unveiling
                  new bus concepts.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-[1.9] mb-8">
                  The sense in 2009 was simple: hydrogen had moved from lab promise to visible reality — even if only
                  through pilots.

                  Hydrogen's appeal was broader than transport: when used in fuel cells it emits only water vapor, can
                  be produced from diverse sources, and was framed as a path to decarbonize mobility, buildings, and
                  power. In Europe, 2009 saw the launch of a major effort through the EU's Fuel Cells and Hydrogen
                  Joint Undertaking. Germany sketched a bold national roadmap and the "H2 Mobility" initiative aimed
                  at building hundreds of fueling stations nationwide.

                  Spectacle mattered. In May 2009, Norway inaugurated the HyNor Hydrogen Highway: a corridor from Oslo
                  to Stavanger with hydrogen fueling stations enabling long-distance travel. To prove it symbolically,
                  Norway's Crown Prince Haakon drove a hydrogen car during the opening rally.

                  In August 2009, Enel opened what was described as the world's first large-scale hydrogen power plant
                  near Venice: a 12 MW turbine burning hydrogen (as an industrial by-product) to generate electricity
                  with zero carbon emissions at the point of use. The project was positioned as proof that hydrogen
                  could matter beyond vehicles.

                  The broader Italian context in 2009 also included regional initiatives: plans for hydrogen fueling
                  stations in Puglia, a Monza pilot to heat part of Villa Reale using fuel cells, and hydrogen
                  appearing in Sicily's energy planning.

                  Japan's 2009 approach was distinct: integrating hydrogen into daily life. The commercial launch of
                  residential fuel-cell CHP systems — Ene-Farm — marked a different idea of scale: not just highways
                  and vehicles, but household energy systems.

                  South Korea treated hydrogen as an industrial opportunity, with hydrogen buses and domestic fuel-cell
                  power ambitions. China, while not yet a leader, began scaling demonstrations planned for the 2010
                  Shanghai Expo, building prototypes and expanding activity beyond the Beijing 2008 glimpse.

                <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-[1.9] mb-8">
                  Even in 2009, hurdles were acknowledged: fuel cell costs, hydrogen storage and transport challenges,
                  and the infrastructure chicken-and-egg problem. But the dominant feeling was that these were solvable
                  details — that hydrogen's "moment" was finally arriving.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-[1.9] mb-8">
                  And that is the point of starting the story here: 2009 wasn't naïve — it was genuinely persuasive,
                  because the world could see hydrogen working in real pilots, across multiple countries, backed by
                  real institutions.
