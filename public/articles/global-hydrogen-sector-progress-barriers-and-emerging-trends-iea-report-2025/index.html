        <div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Executive Overview
Since 2021, the global hydrogen sector has made notable progress, with over 200 low-emissions hydrogen projects committed and demand reaching nearly 100 million tonnes in 2024. However, growth remains uneven and below early expectations due to high costs, uncertain demand, infrastructure bottlenecks, and evolving regulations. Emerging economies and Southeast Asia offer significant potential but face unique challenges in investment and project execution.</p>
        <p>Market &amp; Policy
Hydrogen demand is still dominated by traditional sectors—oil refining, ammonia, methanol, and steelmaking—mostly supplied by fossil-based hydrogen. Low-emissions hydrogen accounts for less than 1% of total demand, hindered by cost gaps and limited policy support. Policy action is shifting from announcements to implementation, with advanced economies leading in funding and regulatory frameworks.</p>
        <p>Demand-side policies, such as quotas and tax incentives, are advancing but lag behind supply-side ambitions. Certification standards and infrastructure regulations are progressing, particularly in the EU, but global harmonization remains a work in progress. Emerging economies could supply a quarter of global low-emissions hydrogen by 2030, but less than 1% of their announced projects have secured investment.</p>
        <div class="article-ad-placeholder" style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 2rem; background: #f9fafb; border: 1px dashed #d1d5db; text-align: center; color: #9ca3af;">Ad Space</div>
        <p>Technology &amp; Innovation
Electrolyser deployment is accelerating, with global installed capacity expected to reach 3 GW by end-2025, mostly driven by China. China leads in manufacturing, accounting for over 60% of global capacity, creating cost advantages but also oversupply risks and international uptake challenges. Innovation is robust across the value chain, including advances in electrolyser technology, hydrogen storage, ammonia synthesis, and end-use applications like shipping and steel.</p>
        <p>However, cost declines for electrolysers are expected to be gradual due to the complexity of hydrogen infrastructure compared to solar PV or EVs.</p>
        <p>Funding &amp; Projects
Capital spending on low-emissions hydrogen is rising, projected to nearly double to USD 8 billion in 2025, mainly in electrolysis and industrial decarbonization. Venture capital for hydrogen start-ups is declining, reflecting broader energy sector trends and risk aversion. Publicly traded hydrogen firms face financial distress, with several bankruptcies and consolidations.</p>
        <p>Development finance institutions are increasing support in emerging markets, but the scale remains limited. Bankability and performance guarantees remain major hurdles for project developers and manufacturers.</p>
        <p>Risks &amp; Constraints
Key barriers include high production costs, uncertain and fragmented demand, slow infrastructure development, and regulatory uncertainty. Less than 5% of announced hydrogen pipelines and storage projects have reached final investment decision. Export-oriented projects, especially in emerging markets, struggle with high capital costs, lack of offtake agreements, and underdeveloped infrastructure.</p>
        <p>In Southeast Asia, abundant renewables and industrial demand present opportunities, but project maturity, high capital costs, policy gaps, and grid integration are significant constraints.</p>
        <p>Outlook
The hydrogen sector is transitioning from pilot projects to early commercial deployment, but the pace is constrained by economic and regulatory headwinds. Accelerating demand creation, lowering capital costs, and building enabling infrastructure are critical for scaling up low-emissions hydrogen. International cooperation, robust certification, and targeted policy support will be essential, especially for emerging economies and key regions like Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p>The sector’s trajectory will depend on closing the gap between ambition and implementation, ensuring bankability, and aligning supply and demand through coordinated policy and market action.</p>
