        <p><a href="/articles/ev-charging-infrastructure-innovation-and-integration" class="internal-link">EV Charging</a> Weekly Update: Funding Unblocked, Industry Pivots, and Focus on Reliability</p>
        <p>Federal <a href="/articles/ev-charging-infrastructure-innovation-and-integration" class="internal-link">EV Charging</a> Funds Back on Track
A $7.5 billion nationwide plan to install fast chargers along highways – designed to combat “range anxiety” – hit a roadblock earlier this year when the administration of President Donald Trump froze its funding. Fewer than 400 new chargers were installed before the halt. In the past week, that logjam began to clear.</p>
        <p>Fourteen states and several nonprofits had sued to restart the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, and a court ruling forced the U.S. Department of Transportation to resume disbursing the $5 billion in charger funds. The Trump administration complied, lifting its freeze on NEVI money, but also issued revised guidance that strips out some of the Biden-era requirements – notably those ensuring a portion of chargers serve rural and disadvantaged areas.</p>
        <p>Previous rules around consumer protection and small-business involvement were also removed in the name of streamlining. This has prompted concern from officials who note that roughly $4.2 billion was stalled since February, and that a purely market-driven buildout might overlook less-profitable locations. Still, the unfreezing of funds is a critical step toward the goal of a charger every 50 miles on major roads, which advocates say is essential to support the growing electric vehicle market.</p>
        <div class="article-ad-placeholder" style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 2rem; background: #f9fafb; border: 1px dashed #d1d5db; text-align: center; color: #9ca3af;">Ad Space</div>
        <p>Range Anxiety and Reliability Challenges
Even as electric vehicle sales climb – over 1.3 million EVs were sold in the U.S. in 2024 – many consumers remain wary about charging on long trips. “Range anxiety” and “charge anxiety” persist, fueled by real infrastructure gaps. A recent study found about 1 in 5 public charging stations in the U.S. is out of order.</p>
        <p>Moreover, chargers aren’t evenly distributed: urban and highway corridors are getting coverage, but vast rural stretches remain “charging deserts” with sparse options for drivers. These reliability and accessibility issues are a major barrier to broader EV adoption. In fact, industry observers warn that America’s EV uptake could slow if charging doesn’t keep pace – one analysis projected that rolling back EV support policies could result in millions fewer EVs on the road by 2030.</p>
        <p>To tackle these challenges, the private sector is innovating on both hardware and software. Startups are working to make charging networks more user-friendly and dependable. For example, Driivz, an EV energy management software platform, has partnered with charging operator Greenspot to improve charger uptime using AI-driven “self-healing” algorithms. The idea is to detect and fix charger faults remotely before drivers even notice a problem.</p>
        <p>Driivz’s system is designed for interoperability – it supports more than 2,000 different charger models and already manages over 200,000 charging stations worldwide, showing that a unified, reliable network is achievable. Meanwhile, automakers and charging providers are converging on common standards to simplify the experience for drivers. Tesla’s connector (NACS) is rapidly becoming a North American standard after adoption by several major carmakers.</p>
        <p>General Motors, for instance, just introduced a NACS adapter that lets its EVs plug into 23,500+ Tesla Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada. This kind of cross-network compatibility means EV owners will have access to many more fast-charging locations without juggling multiple cables or apps – a key step in making “charging anxiety” a thing of the past.</p>
        <p>Charging Safety and Battery Risk under Scrutiny
As charging infrastructure expands, experts are also paying close attention to safety and risk management. Lithium-ion batteries perform well on the road, but the riskiest moment in an EV’s life isn’t driving – it’s during charging, according to Allianz Commercial’s risk consultants.</p>
        <p>High-power charging can strain batteries and charging hardware; an overloaded or faulty charger might overheat the vehicle’s battery system and potentially trigger thermal runaway – a chain reaction of heat and chemical fires inside the battery. While electric cars are significantly less likely to catch fire than gasoline vehicles in general (roughly 25 fires per 100,000 EVs vs. 1,530 per 100,000 gas cars), a notable share of EV fire incidents have been linked to charging malfunctions.</p>
        <p>Estimates suggest 15–30% of EV fires occur during charging, and though such events are rare, they can cause severe damage. For example, a single charging-related fire in May 2025 that spread to multiple vehicles resulted in about $275,000 in losses for vehicles and equipment. These incidents have prompted calls for greater caution in charger deployment. Specialists advise using certified equipment and trained electricians for installations, as well as adhering to updated electrical codes.</p>
        <p>“EV stations are more than just plugs – they’re risk magnets if not installed and maintained properly,” one senior risk consultant noted. Infrastructure operators are also beefing up cybersecurity and physical protection (against vandalism or weather) at charging sites. The bottom line is that as we build out thousands of new chargers, ensuring they are safe and resilient is becoming as important as how many are built.</p>
        <p>Industry Shifts: Business Pivots and Partnerships
The rapid growth of EVs is spurring companies to rethink their strategies and form new alliances in the charging space. In New York City, EV startup Revel – known for its blue electric mopeds and later an all-EV rideshare fleet – announced it is shutting down its ride-hailing business to focus entirely on <a href="/articles/ev-charging-infrastructure-innovation-and-integration" class="internal-link">EV charging</a> infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Competing with Uber and Lyft in ridesharing proved tough, but Revel found success in building public fast-charging hubs. The company operates a handful of large charging stations (five in NYC and one in San Francisco) that were initially used by its own fleet. As more outside drivers began using them, utilization of Revel’s chargers jumped from about 21% in early 2023 to 45% by early 2025, even after the company’s own fleet usage declined.</p>
        <p>A partnership struck in 2024, where Uber directed some of its drivers to Revel’s charging sites, helped boost traffic significantly. Now Revel plans to expand aggressively: it aims to open over 400 fast-charging stalls across New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco by the end of 2026. According to Revel’s CEO, doubling down on charging infrastructure is the best way the company can accelerate EV adoption – by ensuring drivers have a convenient place to plug in.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, established energy and automotive players are forging partnerships to roll out chargers at a larger scale. In an example of cross-industry collaboration, SolarEdge (a leader in solar energy tech) announced a deal with German auto supplier Schaeffler to deploy approximately 2,300 <a href="/articles/ev-charging-infrastructure-innovation-and-integration" class="internal-link">EV charging</a> points in Europe by 2030.</p>
        <p>SolarEdge will supply software, services, and equipment to electrify dozens of Schaeffler sites, starting with the company’s headquarters in Germany, so that employees and fleet vehicles can charge on-site. Such partnerships underline how the <a href="/articles/ev-charging-infrastructure-innovation-and-integration" class="internal-link">EV charging</a> buildout is becoming a priority well beyond the traditional automotive sector – companies in solar, utilities, and real estate are all getting involved in providing charging solutions.</p>
        <p>Public initiatives are ramping up as well. California this week opened the fourth wave of its “Communities in Charge” funding program to spur local EV charger installations. Through rebates and grants, the state is encouraging businesses, multi-unit dwellings, and community sites to install chargers, with an emphasis on serving everyday drivers who lack home charging.</p>
        <p>This is part of California’s multi-pronged effort to meet its ambitious EV goals and ensure charging availability keeps up with the growing number of electric cars on its roads.</p>
        <p>Outlook: Accelerating Infrastructure to Meet EV Growth
Overall, this week’s developments in <a href="/articles/ev-charging-infrastructure-innovation-and-integration" class="internal-link">EV charging</a> highlight a sector racing to catch up with accelerating EV adoption. Governments are freeing up money and easing rules to build chargers faster, while private companies are pivoting and partnering to turn charging infrastructure into the next big business opportunity.</p>
        <p>At the same time, there’s a growing recognition of the qualitative challenges – reliability, ease of use, and safety – that must be addressed alongside sheer numbers of chargers. Solving “range anxiety” involves not just more plugs, but smarter, more dependable networks that drivers of all backgrounds can trust.</p>
        <p>With efforts underway from the federal level to startups and insurers, the push to make <a href="/articles/ev-charging-infrastructure-innovation-and-integration" class="internal-link">EV charging</a> convenient and safe continues to gain momentum, keeping the electric transition fully charged for the road ahead.</p>
