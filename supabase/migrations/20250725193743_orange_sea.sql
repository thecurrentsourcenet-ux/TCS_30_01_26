🔋 Hydrogen Storage Simulation Advances Microgrid Design
A new open-source simulation tool is bringing green hydrogen into the spotlight for remote microgrid systems. Published on ScienceDirect, the model tracks both electrical and thermal energy flows, enabling researchers and engineers to design regenerative hydrogen-powered microgrids with greater accuracy. This breakthrough could accelerate clean energy adoption in cold, off-grid, or seasonal environments.

⚖️ Energy Equity in Microgrid Planning
A recent study has applied Benders decomposition to optimize community microgrid planning with a focus on energy equity. The framework, also featured on ScienceDirect, demonstrated improved outcomes for underserved populations, including better energy access, affordability, and resilience. It''s a critical step forward in designing just and inclusive smart grid infrastructure.

🏛️ Oregon Sets National Benchmark with Microgrid Legislation
Oregon has passed what is being called the most ambitious microgrid policy framework in the United States. The legislation simplifies the process for deploying community-based microgrids and supports grid resilience through local energy generation and storage. This landmark bill could become a model for other states seeking to modernize their energy systems.

☀️ Business Parks Go Solar with Smart Microgrids
The ESS Group has completed a new solar PV and battery storage project at Evegate Business Park. This commercial microgrid system reduces energy costs and boosts reliability for local businesses. As business parks and industrial zones seek energy independence, solar-powered microgrids are emerging as a scalable solution.

🔄 GM Recycles EV Batteries for AI-Powered Microgrid
General Motors has announced a partnership to repurpose used EV batteries for powering an AI data center via a modular microgrid. The system will support Crusoe, an AI infrastructure company, showcasing a circular energy economy that links electric transport, renewable energy, and AI workloads.

🏥 Smart Microgrids for Healthcare Resilience
NextNRG has signed a letter of intent for two smart microgrid projects serving healthcare facilities in Los Angeles County. These installations will improve energy reliability and reduce outages for critical infrastructure — a vital move as hospitals face increasing threats from extreme weather and grid instability.',
  'Comprehensive overview of July 2025 smart grid developments including hydrogen storage simulation tools, energy equity frameworks, Oregon''s landmark microgrid legislation, commercial solar projects, EV battery recycling for AI data centers, and healthcare resilience initiatives.',
